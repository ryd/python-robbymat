# RobbyMat

RobbyMat is a 3 axis maschine at attraktor, a Hamburg based hackerspace. We
try to get control over this maschines on several ways. This one here is a
python based solution, to talk with the serial port.

The protocol of the serial port is very custom, but easy. It's talking with
19200 baud and response only on valid commands.

Commands looks like:
X MOVE 200
or 
Y GOTO 1200

You can also set several axis at once:

XYZ GOTO 0,0,0


More comming soon. Visit us in Hamburg and watch us on youtube.
